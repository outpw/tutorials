# Analysis Tools & ArcToolbox:

### Analysis toolbar:  

Popular and frequently used tools are available with quick access on the Analysis tab. Spend a little time reviewing the analysis tools to see what's available here:

1. Need to find out how many points fall within a radius of a certain place? *Buffer!*  
2. Need to get rid of extra stuff? *Clip it by another layer!*  
3. Need to find out how many points are within a polygon? *Intersect!*  
4. Need to automate boring tasks? *Model Builder or the Python shell!*  
5. __The Help menu__ can provide detailed descriptions of what each tool accomplishes and how to set it up.

### ArcToolbox  

The Analysis menu is only a small fraction of the full set of tools.  

- Open the ArcToolbox to browse the full array of geoprocessing tools:  

  ![Tools Button][ARCPRO15]

- This will open the Geoprocessing pane

- Most find the toolbox difficult to navigate... because it is!  

- To find tools quickly, use the Search bar on the Geoprocessing pane:  

  ![Search for tools][ARCPRO16]

*Not sure what tool to use?* In this case, Google is usually your best friend.
